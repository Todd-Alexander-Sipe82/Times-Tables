**Times Tables** is an application that simulates geometrical patterns, inspired by a Mathologer video, entitled Times Tables, Mandelbrot and the Heart of Mathematics.

**The inputs are as follows:**

- Speed: This is a value from 1 to 20, which determines how quickly it animates between patterns.

- This is a value from 1 to 360 that creates a pattern.

- Points: This determines how many points around the circle the lines will connect to.

**Directions for use:**

Once values have been entered into the Speed, Multiple, and Points fields, press the appropriate buttons to set the values.

- Press Display to see the first scene of what this would look like.

- Press Play to see an animation that continuously changes through a set of chosen colors.

- Press Pause to stop the animation.

- Press Clear to clear the animation on the circle.

The favorites dropdown, and associated Show button, are a set of ten slides that I thought were particularly pretty.
